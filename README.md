Extract the KAX folder, into your KSP Gamedata folder.  

Be sure to properly extract the Firespitter/Resources folder or you will have FScoolant errors on loading the electric prop.  

This mod Requires Firespitter and Module Manager to enable all the features  use the latest versions of their .dll plugins.


### Project Directives

This Management (Lisias) had agreed to oblige himself to the following directives for this project:

* **KAX will remain KAX**
	+ it will not be rolled into another mod
	+ it can be expanded
		- expansions must be in keeping with the tone of the mod
		- it must be vaguely (as much as possible) stockalike. 


## Installation

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder.

**REMOVE ANY OLD VERSIONS OF THE PRODUCT BEFORE INSTALLING**.

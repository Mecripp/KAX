# KAX /L : TODO List

(More or less) Ordered by relevance/kind of priority:

* Get rid of the TODO list.
* Resurrect that gorgeous gears using FSwheel
	+ Yeah, I need to fix the FS gears first
		- Yeah² I'm kinda managed to do that. :)
* C2-B Horizon Cockpit
	+ Check the crew hatch.
		- Kerbal's are being spilled out from the cockpit and there's no apparent way to put them back inside.
	+ Add Light effect to the windshields.
	+ Add a proper Space.
* Revamp the Vintage Propellers configs.
* Check for some idiosyncrasies on the texturing
	+ Check FS too.  
* Idem for the colliders.
* Check for a way to keep KAX's Menu Plugin working too on 1.3.1 and previous
	+ A bit of magic using Reflection will do. 
* Keep an eye on [CPT](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/174189-*) as sugested by [flart](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/180268-*/&do=findComment&comment=3508529). Reference [file](https://github.com/yalov/CommunityPartsTitles/blob/master/GameData/002_CommunityPartsTitles/localization/en-us_kax.cfg).
* Keep an eye on [AJE Extended Configs](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/169520-aje-extended-configs/) for KAX support as suggested by [Citizen247](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/166467-kerbal-aircraft-expansion-_continued-new-management/&do=findComment&comment=3266794).
* Try (again) to create a patch to use that beautiful stainless steel texture from [selfish_meme](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/166467-kerbal-aircraft-expansion-_continued-new-management/&do=findComment&comment=3255902) as an option.
	+ Try to avoid using ModulePartVariants to keep KAX compatible to previous KSP versions
		- If unavoidable, use a optional patch. 
* Make a [better logo](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/180268-14-kerbal-aircraft-expansion-kaxl-—-under-new-management/&do=findComment&comment=3504925). :) 
* Better icons for the Parts Menu
